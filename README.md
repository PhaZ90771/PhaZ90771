### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile

# What am I doing? (as of February 2024)

I am working as a cofounder of a small indie team. We are focusing on preparing a game demo for the Steam Next Fest in June 2025.

In 2023, I completed the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/PhaZ90771/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft" title="Foundational C# with Microsoft Certification">Foundational C# with Microsoft Certification</a>.

# Game Jams

I try to go to game jams about twice a year when the two big local game jams happen. I prefer going to in-person game jams, but sadly this was stopped during the pandemic. I've since started taking part in more online game jams.

# Meetup Host

I am the primary Meetup host for a local game dev group. We meet bimonthly, hosting game testing sessions, member presentations, project show and tells, and directed and freeform discussions.

# Side Projects

I also like to work on side projects from time to time, but they get much less love and attentions than my other activities.
