### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile

# What am I doing? (as of August 2023)

I am developing my Unity skills through the Unity Pathways coursework, and am planning to get my Unity certification in order later this year once I've completed the Pathways coursework.

I am working on an indie project with a team of ~10 people. I am one of the two engineers on this project. We are using Unity. I have been working on this project since Fall 2020. Unfortunately, I am unable to share much at the moment, but hope to be able to link to our website in the near future once we are ready to start showing of our prototype.

# Game Jams

I try to go to game jams about twice a year when the two big local game jams happen. I prefer going to in-person game jams, but sadly this hasn't been able to happen with the ongoing pandemic.

# Meetup Host

I am the primary Meetup host for a local game dev group. We meet bimonthly, hosting game testing sessions, member presentations, project show and tells, and directed and freeform discussions.

# Side Projects

I also like to work on side projects from time to time, but they get much less love and attentions than my other activities.

# Tools of the Trade
> My primary toolset for game development
