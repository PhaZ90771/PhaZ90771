### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile

# What am I doing? (as of September 2021)

I am working on an indie project with a team of ~10 people. I am one of the two engineers on this project. We are using Unity. I have been working on this project since Fall 2020.

Unfortunately, I am unable to share much at the moment, but hope to be able to link to our website in the near future. Once we are ready to start showing of our prototype.

# Game Jams

I try to go to game jams about twice a year when the two big local game jams happen. I prefer going to in-person game jams, but sadly this hasn't been able to happen with the ongoing pandemic.

# Tools of the Trade

My primary toolset includes:
- [Engine] Unity
- [Language] C#.NET
- [Code Editor] Visual Studio
- [Source Control] GitHub
